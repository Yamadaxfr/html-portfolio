<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I really love HoloLive because of their amazing talents especially laplus because she is very cute and small. Theres
  also some talents that i love very much but i will just talk about my oshiis. </p>

<p>These are my oshiis in HoloLive
  <ul>
    <li>Laplus Darkness</li>
    <li>Uruha Rushia</li>
    <li>Minato Aqua</li>
    <li>Koseki Bijou</li>
  </ul> </p>

<p>Because of them, i finally found happiness in my life. Well not only HoloLive of course. My motivation is to help my famil,
  serve my one and only God, and HoloLive. I wish to see them grow and retire happily with their choice.
